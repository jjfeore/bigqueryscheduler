# BigQuery Scheduler

This project is designed to provide an easy to use query scheduler for digital analysts. The Analytics Pros team in Seattle expressed an interest in developing tools to assist their digital analysts, specifically with regard to running BigQuery queries on a user-specified schedule. We are also exploring a number of additional stretch goals for this, to include: an easy query builder, an iOS app, better visualization tools, and the ability to combine and correlate queries with data from an external API (e.g. Twitter).
